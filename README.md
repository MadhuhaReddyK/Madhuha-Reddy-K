Glad to see you here!



 I'm passionate about using data to drive business strategy and identify opportunities for growth and improvement.

My expertise lies in collecting, cleaning and analyzing large datasets using SQL, Python, Excel and various BI tools. I'm adept at understanding business needs and translating them into focused analytical projects. Complex quantitative analyses excite me, and I particularly enjoy the challenge of deriving insights from messy, real-world data.
